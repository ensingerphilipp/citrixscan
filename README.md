# CitrixScan

**Full-scope external security scanner for Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway appliances.**
---

## What It Does

CitrixScan performs a non-exploitative security assessment of internet-facing Citrix NetScaler appliances. It identifies the firmware version, can map it against 25 known CVEs spanning 2019–2026, detects vulnerable configurations, checks for indicators of compromise, and audits TLS and security headers — all without authentication.

The default invocation runs version/product fingerprinting and the security-header module. More intrusive or expensive assessment modules such as CVE evaluation, IoC probing, misconfiguration probing, and TLS auditing must be selected explicitly with `--modules` or enabled together with `--modules all`. Core fingerprinting always runs independently of the selected assessment modules.

### Scan Modules

| Module | What It Checks |
|---|---|
| **Version Fingerprinting** | 10 detection vectors including GZIP timestamp extraction (Fox-IT technique), dynamic release lookup for unknown timestamps, NITRO API probing, EPA binary PE analysis, HTTP header parsing, and static resource hashing |
| **CVE Assessment** | 25 CVEs with version-to-fix mapping, configuration prerequisite validation, in-the-wild exploitation tracking, and public PoC status |
| **IoC Detection** | 15 known webshell/backdoor paths from CVE-2023-3519 campaigns, CISA AA23-201A indicators, with content-based analysis that distinguishes stock NetScaler files from actual implants |
| **Misconfiguration Audit** | 12 paths checked for exposed management interfaces, unauthenticated NITRO API access, configuration file exposure, and diagnostic data leaks — with login-page false positive filtering |
| **TLS Audit** | Protocol version, cipher strength, deprecated cipher detection, certificate expiry |
| **Security Headers** | HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, server version disclosure |
| **Configuration Detection** | SAML IDP, SAML SP, Gateway/VPN, AAA vServer, management interface exposure |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Default scan: version/product fingerprinting and security headers
python3 citrixscan.py 10.0.0.1

# Full security assessment
python3 citrixscan.py 10.0.0.1 --modules all

# Multiple targets with all assessment modules and full reporting
python3 citrixscan.py 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 \
  --modules all -v -o report.json --csv report.csv --markdown report.md

# Bulk default scan from file
python3 citrixscan.py -f targets.txt --threads 10 -o results.json

# List all CVEs in the database

```

### Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **No external dependencies** — stdlib only
- Network access to target(s) on HTTPS port
- For unknown GZIP timestamps: outbound HTTPS access to the official NetScaler release-data service, or an existing local release cache

## Version Fingerprinting

Identifying the firmware version is the foundation of vulnerability assessment. CitrixScan uses 10 detection vectors, tried in priority order:

### 1. GZIP Timestamp Extraction (Primary — Highest Accuracy)

The most reliable unauthenticated fingerprinting technique available. Every NetScaler build ships a compressed language resource file at `/vpn/js/rdx/core/lang/rdx_en.json.gz`. The GZIP file format (RFC 1952) stores a modification timestamp in bytes 4-8 of the header (`MTIME` field). This timestamp is set during firmware compilation and uniquely identifies the build.

CitrixScan embeds a **240-entry lookup table** mapping known timestamps to exact firmware versions, covering timestamps from 12.1-49.23 (August 2018) through builds compiled in March 2026.

Credit: [Fox-IT Security Research Team](https://blog.fox-it.com/2022/12/28/cve-2022-27510-cve-2022-27518-measuring-citrix-adc-gateway-version-adoption-on-the-internet/)

**Known limitation:** Some builds compress this file with `gzip -n`, which zeroes out the MTIME field. In those cases, the scanner falls through to other detection vectors.

### Unknown GZIP Timestamps

If the MTIME is valid but absent from `RDX_EN_STAMP_TO_VERSION`, CitrixScan does not treat an inferred version as an exact match. Instead, it:

1. Queries the JSON backend used by the official NetScaler Release Updates page.
2. Merges the response with the cumulative local cache and the manually maintained Document History file.
3. Excludes releases published before the firmware compilation timestamp.
4. Returns up to three candidates: the release before the best candidate, the best candidate, and the following release.
5. Assigns deterministic relative probabilities centered on the observed seven-day median between compilation and public release.

Example diagnostic:

```text
heuristic candidates: previous=13.1-60.32 (40.6%, release 2025-11-11, +0d);
best=13.1-61.23 (54.0%, release 2025-11-13, +2d);
next=13.1-61.25 (5.4%, release 2025-12-09, +28d)
```

These percentages rank the displayed candidates; they are not statistically calibrated probabilities. Inferred candidates remain `MEDIUM` confidence and are deliberately not passed to CVE evaluation as an exact installed version.

#### Release Data Files

Both files are resolved relative to `citrixscan.py` and therefore belong in the same directory as the script:

```text
citrixscan/
├── citrixscan.py
├── citrix_document_history.json
└── citrix_release_cache.json       # generated automatically
```

- `citrix_release_cache.json` is written automatically after successful release API queries. Updates are cumulative so releases already observed are retained if they later disappear from the API. If the API is unavailable, the existing cache is reused.
- `citrix_document_history.json` is maintained manually. It supplements the API with replaced or withdrawn builds that are still present in the official NetScaler Document History. If this file is absent or invalid, API and cached releases are still used and the scanner records a diagnostic note.

Minimal Document History structure:

```json
{
  "updated_at": "2026-09-22",
  "releases": [
    {
      "full_version": "14.1-51.72",
      "release_date": "2025-09-08",
      "variant": "ADC",
      "source": "document-history"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) or ISO 8601 timestamps for `release_date`. Supported variants are currently `ADC` and `FIPS`.

### 2. NITRO API

Probes `/nitro/v1/config/nsversion` and `/nsversion`. Some appliances return the version in JSON without authentication. Includes login-page false positive filtering — if the response is an HTML login portal instead of JSON, it's correctly rejected.

### 3. HTTP Response Headers

Scans `Server`, `X-NS-version`, `X-Citrix-Version`, `Via`, and `X-NS-Build` headers across all probed endpoints.

### 4. Response Body Firmware Patterns

Regex-scans HTML, JavaScript, and XML responses for firmware-specific strings like `NS14.1: Build 65.11`.

### 5. EPA Binary PE Analysis

Downloads the Endpoint Analysis client (`nsepa_setup.exe`) and scans the PE binary for embedded NetScaler firmware version strings. Includes strict validation to reject Windows build numbers (e.g., `11.0.20348.1`) that are present in the PE metadata but represent the Windows SDK version, not NetScaler firmware.

### 6-10. Additional Vectors

Content-Length fingerprinting, ETag correlation, login page hash mapping, TLS certificate CN/SAN analysis, and plugin version filtering (to reject VPN client versions like `25.5.x.x` that appear in `pluginlist.xml`).

### What If Version Can't Be Determined?

Some hardened appliances gate every resource path (including static files) behind authentication. When this happens, CitrixScan provides detailed diagnostics explaining exactly which paths were tried and what each returned, along with actionable guidance:

```
VERSION UNKNOWN: Authenticate and run 'show ns version' to confirm patch status.
  → Fingerprint diagnostic: rdx_en.json.gz — GZIP valid but MTIME=0 (timestamp stripped)
  → Vulnerable config detected. ASSUME VULNERABLE until version confirmed.
  → EPA binary downloadable. Download nsepa_setup.exe and check file properties.
  → Or use NITRO API with credentials: curl -k -u nsroot:pass https://<IP>/nitro/v1/config/nsversion
```

### CVE Applicability Logic

Each CVE has defined configuration prerequisites. For example, CVE-2026-3055 requires SAML IDP configuration and CVE-2026-4368 requires Gateway or AAA vServer configuration. CitrixScan detects these configurations externally and reports whether the vulnerability is confirmed applicable or unconfirmed (requires CLI verification):

```
CVE-2026-3055  CVSS  9.3 CRITICAL  [SAML IDP] ✓ config confirmed
CVE-2026-4368  CVSS  7.7 HIGH      [Gateway]  ✓ config confirmed
CVE-2025-12101 CVSS  5.1 MEDIUM               ? config unconfirmed
```

## IoC Detection

Probes 15 paths associated with known post-exploitation activity, primarily from CVE-2023-3519 campaigns documented in [CISA Advisory AA23-201A](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-201a).

### Content-Based Analysis

The scanner distinguishes between:

- **Stock NetScaler files** (e.g., `newbm.pl`, `rmbm.pl`) — legitimate bookmark management scripts that ship with every Gateway install. These are not flagged.
- **Trojaned stock files** — Stock paths containing webshell indicators (PHP eval, system calls, etc.). Flagged as CRITICAL.
- **Non-stock webshells** — Files at IoC paths with malicious content. Flagged as CRITICAL with content preview.
- **Modified stock files** — Stock paths with unexpected content not matching legitimate signatures. Flagged as HIGH.

Each finding includes a content preview (first 150 characters) so analysts can validate without manual investigation.

---

## Misconfiguration Detection

Probes 12 paths for security misconfigurations:

| Category | Paths Checked | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| NITRO API exposure | `/nitro/v1/config/nsconfig`, `/nsip`, `/sslcertkey`, `/nshardware`, `/stat/system` | CRITICAL / HIGH |
| Management interface | `/menu/neo`, `/menu/ss`, `/gui/` | CRITICAL |
| Configuration files | `/nsconfig/ns.conf` | CRITICAL |
| Log files | `/var/log/ns.log` | CRITICAL |
| Diagnostic data | `/var/nslog/newnslog`, `/var/nstrace/` | HIGH |

### Login Page False Positive Filtering

Many NetScaler appliances return the login portal HTML with `200 OK` for any unauthenticated request path. CitrixScan detects this pattern using 20+ login page markers (including `logonpoint`, `receiver.appcache`, `visibility: hidden`, `noindex, nofollow`) and only flags endpoints that return actual content — JSON API responses, configuration file syntax, log data, or real management UI HTML.
